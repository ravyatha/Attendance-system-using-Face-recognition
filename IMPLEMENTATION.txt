IMPLEMENTATION:

To install IDLE (Integrated Development and Learning Environment), which is the default Python IDE, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Check Python installation
Before installing IDLE, ensure that Python is installed on your system.
python --version


Step 2: Verify Python package manager (pip)
Check if you have pip installed by entering the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
pip --version


Step 3: Install IDLE using pip
Once you have verified that Python and pip are installed, you can proceed to install IDLE. Open a command prompt or terminal and enter the following command:
pip install idle

Step 4: Launch IDLE
After the installation is complete, you can launch IDLE by entering the following command in the command prompt or terminal:
idle

The IDLE editor window should open, and you can start writing and running Python code.

That's it! You have successfully installed IDLE. Remember to save your Python files with a .py extension and use the editor to execute or run your code.
